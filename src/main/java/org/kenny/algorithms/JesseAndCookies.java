 * Problem:
 * Jesse loves cookies. He wants the sweetness of all his cookies to be greater than value `K`. To do this, Jesse repeatedly mixes two of the cookies in his hand. Each cookie has a sweetness value which is a positive integer. The sweetness of two cookies is the sum of their individual sweetness values.
 *
 * You are given an array of sweetness values of cookies and the value `K`. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve Jesse's goal. If it is not possible to do so, return -1.
 *
 * Write a function `cookies` to find the minimum number of operations required to make all the cookies have sweetness greater than or equal to `K`.
 *
 * Function Signature:
 * `int cookies(int k, int[] A)`
 *
 * Input:
 * - An integer `k` representing the desired minimum sweetness value.
 * - An array `A` of integers representing the sweetness values of the cookies. The length of the array is between 1 and 10^6.
 *
 * Output:
 * - Return an integer representing the minimum number of operations required to achieve Jesse's goal. If it is not possible, return -1.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * `k = 7`
 * `A = [1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 12]`
 * Output:
 * `2`
 *
 * Explanation:
 * - Initially, the sweetness values are [1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 12].
 * - After two operations, the sweetness values become [13, 12, 9], which are all greater than or equal to 7.
 *
 * Note:
 * - The array `A` can contain duplicates.
 * - The operations can be performed on any pair of cookies at a time.
 * - The sweetness values of the cookies may change after each operation.
 * - If it is not possible to achieve Jesse's goal, return -1.
