/**
 * Question: Given a binary tree, write a function to find its maximum depth.
 * The maximum depth is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node to the deepest leaf node.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 *      3
 *     / \
 *    9  20
 *      /  \
 *     15   7
 *
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The maximum depth is 3, as the longest path from the root node (3) to any leaf node is [3 -> 20 -> 15] or [3 -> 20 -> 7].
 * Write a function maxDepth that takes the root of a binary tree as input and returns the maximum depth as an integer.
