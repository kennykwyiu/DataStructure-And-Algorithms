/**
 * Here's a question related to calculating the sum of leaf nodes in a binary tree:
 * <p>
 * Question: Given a binary tree, write a function to calculate the sum of all leaf nodes.
 * Each node in the tree contains a value and has either zero or two children.
 * The leaf nodes are the nodes that do not have any children.
 * Implement the function `binaryTreeLeafSum` that takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns the sum of all leaf node values.
 * <p>
 * For example, given the following binary tree:
 * <p>
 * ```
 *        5
 *       / \
 *      3   8
 *     / \   \
 *    2   4   9
 *   /       / \
 * 1       7   10
 * ```
 * <p>
 * The leaf nodes are 1, 4, 7, and 10. The sum of these leaf nodes is 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 = 22.
 * <p>
 * Write the `binaryTreeLeafSum` function in a programming language of your choice and provide the solution to the problem.
